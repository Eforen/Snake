# Snake
Python Implementation of Classic Style Snake

To test my skills I made this Snake Clone in about 8 hours in one sitting. I am very pleased with the result! It probably would not have taken as long if I did not have as much fun "Testing" it.

Please do try it out and if you want play with the code some!
